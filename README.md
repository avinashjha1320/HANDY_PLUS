# HANDY_PLUS
Many of us find it difficult to **search for a hospital** with desired facilities at the time of emergency. In a new city when we are looking for a hospital, we don’t know whether we are going to the correct place or just wasting time by visiting the hospital which doesn’t have sufficient beds, doctors, types of machinery, and other required facilities. It may happen that the nearer hospital doesn’t have a doctor or rooms, so rather than risking the life of the patient, it would be better to go to a hospital where there are hopes for saving the patient because time plays a vital role in such cases. Big 5 stars hospitals are not only the hospitals that can save someone’s life. It may happen a good hospital that is at a shorter distance in the nearby locality can save someone’s life rather than losing life while traveling a long distance for those 5-star hospitals. In India, a lot of precious time is been wasted while taking a heart attack patient, and **50% of them lose their life before reaching the hospital** [Read More](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-50-of-heart-attack-cases-reach-hospital-late-govt-data-shows/story-penFdsewgGwpIwiQnRDoLJ.html). 

So we have decided to make a web app that will not only help to **find the most appropriate hospital according to need** rather will also make the **process of admitting patients easy**. All major and minor hospitals will be listed with categories of all the updated facilities they provide and the current status of those facilities like the number of beds available, number of doctors available, medical check machines, and all other relevant details.

### Features
- To build a user-friendly and quick nearby hospital status showing app.
- Quick patient admitting and bed booking facilities.
- Live status of all the available facilities of the hospital.
- Facilities feedback review system.
